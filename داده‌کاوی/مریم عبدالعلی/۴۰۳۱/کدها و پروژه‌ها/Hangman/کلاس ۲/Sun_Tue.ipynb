    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Preprocessing:\n",
    "    - Remove missing values\n",
    "    - remove duplicates\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering:\n",
    "    - Extract the \"Age\" of a customer by the \"Year_Birth\" indicating the birth year of the respective person.\n",
    "    - Create another feature \"Spent\" indicating the total amount spent by the customer in various categories over the span of two years.\n",
    "    - Create another binary feature \"Living_With: {\"Alone, Partner}\" out of \"Marital_Status\" to extract the living situation of couples.\n",
    "    - Create a feature \"Children\" to indicate total children in a household that is, sum of kids and teenagers.\n",
    "    - To get further clarity of household, Creating feature indicating \"Family_Size\"\n",

    "    - Dropping some of the redundant features\n",
    "        \n",
    "        to_drop = [\"Marital_Status\", \"Dt_Customer\", \"Z_CostContact\", \"Z_Revenue\", \"Year_Birth\", \"ID\"]\n",

    "3. Convert the categorical features using LabelEncoder\n",
    "4. Scale data\n",
    "5. Project data into 3 dimensions using PCA\n",
    "6. Apply Kmeans to cluster the data into 3 clusters\n",
    "7. Analyze each cluster"
